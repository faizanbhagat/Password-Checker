# Password-Checker
Program that takes in an input of passwords through a .txt file and checks if they meet basic password criteria. 

Password criteria can either be pre determined (8 characters long, 1 special character, 1 number, and a mix of lowercase and uppercase) or can be custom determined by the user. 

Program then prints out each password and the tests that it fails, if any. Program will help alert the user as to what they need to add to each passwords to create a successful test.
